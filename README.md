# pglockanalyze-action

*Status: **work-in-progress** — the interface may change.*

Runs [`pglockanalyze`](https://crates.io/crates/pglockanalyze) against with one
or more migration files (i.e. files containing DDL statements) to analyze,
and reports the results inline in the diff.

You bring your own `postgres:` service container (any version), specify the
connection parameters and the action executes pglockanalyze against it, using
the files you provided.

Also, you have to make sure to provision the database so that it's in a proper
state for the analysis to be possible (e.g. if you have pre-existing migrations
that should not be analyzed, you are responsible for running them).
